### Day 1 – Login Page using Bootstrap

This project is part of my **30 Days Coding Challenge**, where I try to code every day and build small projects to improve my frontend development skills.
For Day 1, I created a simple and responsive **login page** using HTML and Bootstrap.

## What this project is about

It’s a clean login UI with a basic form layout.  
I focused more on **structure, responsiveness, and clean design** rather than complex functionality.

## Features

- Responsive layout using Bootstrap grid
- Simple and clean card design
- Username and password fields
- HTML form validation (no JavaScript used)
- Submit button matches input width
- Works well on mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5
